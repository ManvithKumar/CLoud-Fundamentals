Virtual Networks

Azure virtual networks (Vnet) is the fundamental building block for you private network in Azure

AZure virtual network is the representationof your own network in the cloud.

Key Features:
Internet communication
Comunicate between Axure resources
Route network traffic
Communicate with on-premises resources
Filter network traffic
Connect virtual networks.

UDR
user defined routing is a significant update to azure's virtual networks as this allows network admins to control the routing tables btw subnets within a Vnet.

VPN Gateway

A VPN gateway is a specifc type of virtual network gateway, which is used to send encrypted traffic btw an azure virtual network and an-premises location over the public internet.

All transferred data is encrypted in aprivate tunnel as it 	crosses the internet

Peering 

Virtual networks peering enables us to connect two VNet in the same or across regions.If both of the virtual networks are in azure and also within the same region, then you can use peering.

Global Peering

If we have a virtual network in azure that exists in different regions, then we can use global peering

Site to Site

On premises virtual network, we may have other virtual networks existing int other cloud providers.

Express Route

We have a bussiness requirement where this connection btw our on-premises data center and virtua network should be on aprivate channel of communication

Points to remember while peering

Peering btw VNets is allowed in the same subscriptions
