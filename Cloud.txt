Cloud
	Cloud refers to a network or internet.
	Cloud is something which is present at remote location.
	Cloud can provide services over network public networks or on private networks like WAN,LAN.
	Applications such as email,web conference.

CLoud Computing

	cloud Computing is the delivery of different services through the internet.
	Enables tools and applications like data storage,servers networks.
	on-demand services like compute,storage and networking etc
Cloud Computing Provides:
	
	Pay as a you go payment mode.
	Is accessible from most part of the world
	Can be accessed through internet
	Vendor takes care of manageing andmonitoring these services.
	The resouces provided can scale up and down depending upon the requirement.
Benfits of having not data-center:

	Less management
	Less investment
	Less operations
	Focus on bussiness

Azure fundamentals

	Azure core compute
	Network
	Storage
	Database services
	Cloud security best practices
	Iot and machine learning

Characteristics of Cloud Computing 
	on-demnd self-service
	Broad network access
	Resource pooling 
	Rapid elastiicty
	Measured services

Advantages of Cloud

	Cost 
	Agility
	Service Quality
	Integration of latest technology
	High Availabilty
	Reliability with Real time failover
	Disaster recovery
	Ease of Management

Benefits of cloud computing 

Availability = uptime/uptime+downtime
uptime :- computer indistry term used for the time during which a computer is operational.
downtime :- time when it isnt operational. 


Levels of availability
levels		Percent of uptine 	Downtime per year 	Downtime per day	
4 Nine		99.99%			52.6 Minutes		8.6 seconds
5 Nine		99.999%			5.25 Minutes		0.86 seconds
6 Nine		99.99999%		31.5 Seconds		8.6 milliseconds


Scalabilty
:
Vertical Scaling 
Horizontal Scaling

Elasticity:
Ability of a system to automatically grow and shrink based on application demand

Agility:
	The ability to chane rapidly based on changes to market or envirnoment
	Agility is the ability to allocate and deallocate resource
	Agility is acheived in cloud computing because of its elasticity and flexibilty

Fault Tolerance:
	Fualt tolerance is the ablity to remain up and running during component and service failures.

	The ability of a system to hancle faults like:
	Power
	Networking 
	Hardware failures

Disaster Recovery:
	 The ability of a system to recover from failuere within a period of time, and how much data is lost
	 Disaster is a serious diruption of services caused

CapEx and OpEx
CapEx:
	One time aproach
	Property or equipment
	Longer life span
	It is the initial spending of money
	the up front cost from CaopEx has a value the reduces over time
OpEx:
	It is like a pay as you go
	Operating cost
	Life span depends on the payment
	Consumables, wages , rent, maintaince and repair of machinary

Consumption based model

pay for what you use
pay per minute
pay per hour 
pay per execution
